Notice that in addition to my own code that I included here, I also included 1 file from the kmk library: [`kmk_keyboard.py`](./kmk/kmk_keyboard.py). This is because I made a small update to the update loop in this file to allow me to check for updates/update the OLED display. You can see the call I made on line 508 of that file, calling my custom `onUpdate()` function that is defined in `code.py`. I also made an update on line 503 to pass in a reference to this function.
